# tracktimer
A visualizer for a 400m track time. The track is proportional 1px to 1 meter and is based on 
[these dimensions](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/may12015/index.html). 

## p5.js Adaptation
I also made a p5.js adaptation so it can be viewed on a mobile device and perhaps used while running.
The webapp includes an input box to base the visualizer's pace on any 400m time
