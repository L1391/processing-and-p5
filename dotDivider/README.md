# dotDivider
A visualizer of how you can always find two points in a set of 
even number n random points that divide the group into two parts of (n-2)/2 points.
  
This is based on the [Extreme Value Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theorem). 
By finding one of the extreme points, farthest left, right, up, or down, there then exist some other point
which together create a dividing line. There exists some middle point.
